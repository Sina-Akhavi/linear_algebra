## Linear Algebra Laboratories

In this repository, I have done several labs (practices) for the course Linear Algebra in the KNTU university. The instructor of the course is [Behrooz Nasihatkon](https://wp.kntu.ac.ir/nasihatkon/).

The repository consists of several laboratories that have covered some important concepts in linear algebra such as vectorization, span, basis, linear combination of vectors and so on.

The practices have been done by python utilizing modules such as numpy, matplotlib.

Each lab has its own instruction, a PDF file, that is enclosed in its directory.

**Installation:**

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib

pip install numpy numpy
